# Downloads File Mover
This program cleans up your downloads folder by creating necessary folders and moving the most common file types into their matching folders.

# Getting Started
To run this program for yourself, first clone the GitHub repo. As this program has been packaged using PyInstaller, once you have cloned the repo all you need to do is run the main.exe file that is stored in the dist/main folder.

This should then create the below folders in your downloads folder (if not already there)

After the creation the script then moves loose files into the folders (depending on file type)

# Next Steps / Upgrades
- Make the script a service to run 24/7
- Introduce more file types
- Advanced error handeling
